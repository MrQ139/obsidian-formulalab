# FormulaLab

FormulaLab is a local Obsidian plugin for rendering interactive engineering equations directly inside Markdown notes.

It is designed for aerospace engineering notes, propulsion calculations, experimental logs, and lightweight scientific modeling workflows where equations need to be explored visually rather than stored as static text.

## Project Position

FormulaLab is intended to sit between three tools:

- **Obsidian** for research notes and knowledge management
- **mathjs** for safe scalar equation evaluation
- **Plotly.js** for interactive curve visualization

It also ships two teaching-scale CFD blocks: `cfd-cells`, which explains finite-volume discretization cell by cell, and `ns2d`, a validated 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes solver that runs in the note. They are built for understanding, not for production engineering analysis; FormulaLab is not a symbolic algebra system or a general-purpose CFD code.

## Features

- Formula-driven 2D plots: the formula is typeset, the current value is shown in large type and read off the curve, and `marks` draw reference lines such as a critical pressure ratio
- `flow-scene`: five animated textbook flows whose particles follow the actual velocity field, with the equation's terms coloured like the drawing
- `cfd-cells`: finite-volume cells you can click to see each cell's discrete equation, scheme behaviour (central/upwind/hybrid/power-law), CFL stability, and iterative solver convergence
- `ns2d`: 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes on a staggered MAC grid with projection, stepped phase by phase (predictor → pressure Poisson → correction), with lid-driven cavity, channel, Couette, and cylinder-wake cases validated against benchmark and analytic solutions
- Pitot differential pressure velocity calculator for high-pressure N2 crossflow notes
- One independent variable
- Multiple slider-controlled parameters
- Plotly.js interactive graph
- Numbers shown with three significant digits (`5.00×10⁵` instead of `5.0000e+5`)
- YAML-based code block configuration
- Local bundling with no CDN dependency
- Safe expression evaluation with mathjs, no `eval()`

## Installation

### Install with BRAT (until it is in the community directory)

1. Install **BRAT** from Community plugins.
2. Run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing** and enter `MrQ139/obsidian-formulalab`.
3. Enable **FormulaLab** in Community plugins. BRAT keeps it updated from new releases.

### Install manually

Download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/MrQ139/obsidian-formulalab/releases/latest) into:

```text
path/to/Vault/.obsidian/plugins/formulalab/
```

Then reload Obsidian and enable **FormulaLab** in Community plugins. `main.js` is built for each release and is not committed to the repository.

### Releasing

1. Update `version` in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, add the version to `versions.json` (value: `minAppVersion`), and add a `## x.y.z` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Commit, then push a tag equal to the version, without `v`:

```powershell
git tag 0.5.1
git push origin 0.5.1
```

The release workflow builds, runs the tests, checks the tag against `manifest.json`, and publishes the release with `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` attached.

### Development build

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm test          # solver validation (cavity benchmark, analytic profiles, FVM textbook cases)
npm run harness   # visual harness at http://localhost:5178/dev/index.html
npm run check-note -- note.md   # parse every FormulaLab block in a note
```

On Windows, paths with spaces or parentheses are mangled by npm; run `node dist/validate-note.cjs "path to note.md"` after one `npm run check-note` build instead.

If `npm install` is very slow inside a synced Google Drive folder, copy the plugin folder to a local temporary folder, run `npm install` and `npm run build` there, then copy the generated `main.js` back into `.obsidian/plugins/formulalab/`.

## Usage

Create a markdown code block with the `formulalab` language:

````markdown
```formulalab
title: Quadratic Function
mode: function
formula: a*x^2 + b*x + c
x: x
x_min: -10
x_max: 10
x_init: 2

params:
  a:
    value: 1
    min: -5
    max: 5
    step: 0.1
  b:
    value: 0
    min: -10
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
  c:
    value: 0
    min: -10
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
```
````

For the built-in Pitot velocity calculator, use `pitot-velocity` or `pitot-n2`:

````markdown
```pitot-velocity
p0: 20.010
pstatic: 20.000
unit: MPa
rho: 220
```
````

For lightweight interactive fluid mechanics simulators, use `flow-scene`:

````markdown
```flow-scene
title: Pipe Poiseuille Flow
type: pipe-poiseuille
particles: 36
show_profile: true

params:
  umax:
    value: 2
    min: 0.2
    max: 5
    step: 0.05
  R:
    value: 1
    min: 0.2
    max: 2
    step: 0.05
```
````

Supported `flow-scene` types:

| Type | What you see | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipe-poiseuille` | Dye lines released at the same moment bend into the parabolic profile; particles move at `u(r)`; tap to read the speed at a radius | `umax`, `R` |
| `material-derivative` | A fixed sensor and a moving particle in a field that changes in space and time, with the last 8 s each recorded, so `∂φ/∂t` and `Dφ/Dt` separate | `U`, `gradient`, `oscillation` |
| `control-volume-flux` | A tank inside a control volume: inflow and outflow particle streams, and a water level that rises at `ṁ_in − ṁ_out` | `inflow`, `outflow` |
| `streamline-pathline-streakline` | The "flapping hose" `u = U, v = V₀ sin ω(t − x/U)`: a particle flies straight (pathline), the dye from the nozzle waves with growing amplitude (streakline), the instantaneous streamlines are a third curve | `U`, `unsteady` |
| `bernoulli-streamtube` | A Venturi tube drawn at its real elevation with the energy line, hydraulic grade line and stacked head columns (z, p/ρg, V²/2g); warns when the pressure head goes negative | `flow`, `constriction`, `zRise` |

Scenes play on their own (`autoplay: false` to start paused) and pause when scrolled off screen. Each scene shows its equation with every term in the colour of the thing that shows it in the drawing, one short explanation, a colour legend with live values, and the canvas; where it helps, tapping the canvas moves a probe, sensor or nozzle.

Older blocks keep working. Parameters the redrawn scenes no longer use (`storage` for the control volume, which is now `inflow − outflow`; `shear`; `viscosity`) are ignored.

The goal is not to show generic 2D function plots. Use `flow-scene` when the learner needs to connect a formula to a physical region, flux, particle, streamline, or head exchange.

### Finite volumes cell by cell: `cfd-cells`

````markdown
```cfd-cells
type: convection-diffusion
scheme: central        # central | upwind | hybrid | power-law
cells: 5
velocity: 0.1
diffusivity: 0.1
phi_left: 1
phi_right: 0
```
````

| Type | What it teaches | Main fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `convection-diffusion` | Steady 1D convection–diffusion (Patankar; Versteeg & Malalasekera ch. 5). Click a cell to see `a_P φ_P = a_W φ_W + a_E φ_E + S_u` with numbers; negative coefficients and cell Péclet > 2 are flagged; exact solution overlay | `scheme`, `cells`, `velocity`, `diffusivity`, `phi_left`, `phi_right` |
| `advection` | Transient linear advection; numerical diffusion vs. dispersion, CFL stability, FTCS instability | `scheme` (`upwind`, `lax-wendroff`, `lax-friedrichs`, `ftcs`), `courant`, `cells`, `shape` (`square`, `gauss`) |
| `diffusion-2d` | Steady 2D conduction on a grid of cells; Jacobi vs. Gauss–Seidel vs. SOR convergence with residual history; click a cell for its equation | `cells`, `left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom` (number or `insulated`), `source`, `method`, `omega` |

### 2D Navier–Stokes: `ns2d`

````markdown
```ns2d
case: cavity           # cavity | channel | couette | obstacle
re: 100
grid: 32
scheme: hybrid         # hybrid | upwind | central
field: speed           # speed | vorticity | pressure | divergence | u | v
tracers: true
arrows: false
autoplay: false
```
````

Each time step is shown as the three projection-method phases. **단계별 ▷** runs one phase at a time and switches the view to what that phase produced: the divergence of the predicted velocity u*, the pressure field, then the divergence-free result. Validation plots update live: centreline u against Ghia et al. (1982) for the cavity at Re = 100/400/1000, the analytic Poiseuille and Couette profiles, and a wake probe with a Strouhal-number estimate for the cylinder.

The solver uses the MAC discretization of Griebel, Dornseifer & Neunhoeffer (donor-cell/central blended convection, SOR pressure Poisson). All quantities are non-dimensional (U = 1, ρ = 1, ν = UL/Re; the cylinder case uses its diameter D = 0.2 as L).

## Validation

`npm test` runs the solver checks in Node:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Versteeg & Malalasekera Example 5.1, central scheme, 5 cells | all cell values within 5×10⁻⁴ of the textbook |
| Central scheme at cell Pe > 2 | negative coefficient and unbounded wiggles detected; upwind stays bounded |
| Lid-driven cavity, Re = 100, 48×48 | max \|u − Ghia\| on the vertical centreline ≈ 0.005 |
| Poiseuille channel / Couette flow | max error vs. analytic profile 0.0011 / < 10⁻⁴ |
| Cylinder wake | bounded, mass-conserving; Strouhal ≈ 0.16 at Re = 120 in the browser |
| Projection | removes > 99.99 % of the predictor divergence each step |

| `title` | No | Card title |
| `mode` | No | Display badge such as `function` or `engineering` |
| `formula` | Yes | mathjs-compatible formula |

Each parameter requires `value`, `min`, `max`, and `step`. It may also include `label`.

## Current Limitations

The first stable direction is deliberately narrow:

- Scalar numeric formulas only in `formulalab` blocks
- One independent variable per `formulalab` block
- `ns2d` is 2D, uniform-grid, laminar and first/second-order; the cylinder is a staircase approximation
- No matrix expressions
- No symbolic simplification
- No contour plots or 3D plots
- No external data overlay yet
- No built-in regime map generator yet

These limits keep the plugin useful for engineering notes without turning it into a large simulation platform.

## Roadmap

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

## Plotly Bundling Notes

This plugin uses `plotly.js-basic-dist-min` (scatter, bar, and pie only, about 1 MB). Plotly and mathjs are loaded with dynamic `import()` the first time a block needs them, so enabling the plugin does not slow Obsidian's startup; in a browser measurement the plugin load went from about 1.4 s (0.4.0, full Plotly evaluated at load) to about 0.06 s.

If you see build errors involving Node built-ins, confirm that `obsidian`, `electron`, and Node built-in modules are listed as external in `esbuild.config.mjs`.

## mathjs Notes

FormulaLab uses mathjs syntax. Common functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `abs` work. Use `^` for powers.
